        <p>
          In an age where expression is one of the most powerful tools a person can possess, dance has become more than just a form of art. It is a way of moving that uses the body as an instrument of expression and communication. Through dance, one can learn teamwork, focus, and improvisation. Hence, the initiative to create the KMIT dance club was taken. We aim to bring talented students across all years under one roof and on one platform. The name we chose, Mudra, is a prominent term in a dancerâ€™s vocabulary and is one of the most significant features of Indian classical dance.
